# Feature Specification: Merc Auto Bogatka Workshop Management System

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-a-merc`  
**Created**: 2025-09-06  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build a \"Merc Auto Bogatka\" app. It's a workshop management tool for Mercedes-Benz service centers. The app should allow: - Service advisors to create bookings and estimates, - Technicians to log jobs and follow model-specific checklists, - Customers to receive updates and approve extra work online. The main goal: reduce paperwork and admin overhead, improve customer transparency, and ensure OEM-compliant service records."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → ✅ Feature description parsed: Workshop management tool for Mercedes-Benz service centers
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → ✅ Identified: actors (service advisors, technicians, customers), actions (bookings, estimates, job logging, updates), data (service records), constraints (OEM compliance)
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → ✅ Authentication: Appwrite email/password with role-based access (service advisors, technicians, customers)
   → [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Data retention and backup requirements not specified]
   → ✅ Integration: Mercedes-Benz Developer API for VIN decoding and vehicle specifications, Allegro API for parts listing and inventory
   → ✅ Performance: 50-100 concurrent users, <200ms page load, 10k+ service records annually
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → ✅ Clear user flows identified for all three user types
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → ✅ All requirements are testable and specific
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   → ✅ Entities identified: Customer, Vehicle, Booking, Estimate, Job, Checklist, Service Record
7. Run Review Checklist
   → WARN "Spec has uncertainties - clarifications needed"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning with noted clarifications)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A Mercedes-Benz service center operates efficiently with minimal paperwork where service advisors can quickly create bookings and estimates, technicians can systematically complete work following manufacturer guidelines, and customers stay informed and can authorize additional work remotely.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a customer needs service, **When** a service advisor creates a booking with vehicle details and service requirements, **Then** the system generates a booking reference and notifies relevant technicians
2. **Given** a technician is working on a vehicle, **When** they access the model-specific checklist, **Then** they can systematically log each completed task with timestamps and notes
3. **Given** additional work is discovered during service, **When** a technician logs the extra work needed, **Then** the customer receives a notification with estimate and can approve/decline online
4. **Given** service work is completed, **When** all checklists are marked complete, **Then** an OEM-compliant service record is automatically generated
5. **Given** a customer wants service updates, **When** they check their booking status, **Then** they see real-time progress and completed work items

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a customer doesn't respond to extra work approval within a reasonable timeframe?
- How does the system handle partial checklist completion when a technician's shift ends?
- What occurs when a vehicle model's checklist is updated while service is in progress?
- How are emergency or rush jobs prioritized in the booking system?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*
