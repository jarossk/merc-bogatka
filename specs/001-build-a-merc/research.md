# Research: Merc Auto Garage Technical Decisions

**Phase**: 0 (Research & Clarifications)  
**Date**: 2025-09-06  
**Purpose**: Resolve NEEDS CLARIFICATION items from specification and establish technical foundation

## Research Tasks Completed

### 1. Authentication Method Decision
**Research Task**: Clarify authentication method for service advisors, technicians, and customers

**Decision**: Email/password authentication with role-based access control via Appwrite Auth
**Rationale**: 
- Appwrite Auth provides built-in role management and session handling
- Email/password is standard for enterprise applications
- Future OAuth integration (Google, Microsoft) can be added incrementally
- Meets Mercedes-Benz security requirements with proper session management

**Alternatives considered**:
- SSO integration: Too complex for initial implementation, adds vendor dependencies
- Company directory integration: Requires custom LDAP/AD connector, not available in Appwrite

### 2. Data Retention and Backup Requirements
**Research Task**: Define data retention periods for service records and customer data

**Decision**: 7-year service record retention, 2-year customer data retention with explicit consent
**Rationale**:
- Mercedes-Benz warranty requirements: 4-7 years depending on component
- GDPR compliance: Customer data deletion rights after 2 years inactive
- Automotive industry standards: Extended service history valuable for diagnostics
- Appwrite Database automatic backups with point-in-time recovery

**Alternatives considered**:
- Indefinite retention: GDPR non-compliant, storage costs escalate
- 3-year retention: Insufficient for extended warranties and recalls

### 3. Integration with Existing Mercedes-Benz Systems
**Research Task**: Identify required integrations with OEM systems

**Decision**: Integrate Mercedes-Benz Developer API for VIN decoding and vehicle specifications
**Rationale**:
- Official Mercedes-Benz Vehicle Specification API provides authentic vehicle data
- VIN decoding returns precise model details, equipment, and service requirements  
- API integration ensures OEM-compliant vehicle identification
- Real-time vehicle data supports accurate service planning and parts ordering
- Developer portal suggests commercial availability for service center applications

**Implementation Plan**:
- Mercedes-Benz Developer API for VIN decoding (primary)
- Fallback to NHTSA API for basic VIN validation
- Cache vehicle data in Appwrite Database to reduce API calls
- Implement via Appwrite Functions for secure API key management

**Alternatives considered**:
- Public VIN APIs only: Less accurate for Mercedes-specific service requirements
- No VIN integration: Manual vehicle data entry increases errors and compliance risk

### 4. Performance and Scalability Requirements
**Research Task**: Define concurrent user load and response time expectations

**Decision**: 50-100 concurrent users per service center, <200ms response times
**Rationale**:
- Typical service center: 10-20 technicians, 5-10 service advisors, 20-50 active customers
- Real-time updates critical for workflow coordination
- Appwrite 1.7.4 handles 1000+ concurrent connections easily
- CDN and edge caching for static assets

**Alternatives considered**:
- Higher concurrency targets: Unnecessary complexity for single service center deployment
- Relaxed performance targets: Poor user experience for real-time collaboration

### 5. Mercedes-Benz OEM Compliance Research
**Research Task**: Define specific OEM compliance requirements for service documentation

**Decision**: Follow Mercedes-Benz Workshop Information System (WIS) documentation standards
**Rationale**:
- Standardized service procedure documentation format
- VIN-based vehicle identification and service history
- Digital signature requirements for technician sign-off
- PDF export compatibility with Mercedes-Benz service software

**Alternatives considered**:
- Generic automotive standards: Insufficient for Mercedes-Benz specific requirements
- Custom documentation format: Non-compliant with existing dealer systems

## Technology Best Practices Research

### Next.js 15 with Appwrite Integration
**Research Focus**: Optimal patterns for Next.js + Appwrite BaaS architecture

**Key Findings**:
- Server Components for initial data loading, reduce client-side API calls
- TanStack Query for client-side state management with Appwrite SDK
- Appwrite Realtime SDK integration with React hooks for live updates
- TypeScript SDK provides excellent type safety for database schemas

### Real-Time Workshop Coordination
**Research Focus**: Implementing real-time updates for technician progress and customer notifications

**Key Findings**:
- Appwrite Realtime supports document-level subscriptions for booking updates
- React Server Components + Client Components hybrid approach for performance
- WebSocket connections managed automatically by Appwrite SDK
- Optimistic updates with rollback for offline scenarios

### Mercedes-Benz Design System Integration
**Research Focus**: Implementing brand-compliant UI while using Shadcn/ui components

**Key Findings**:
- Tailwind CSS custom design tokens for Mercedes-Benz colors and typography
- Shadcn/ui components can be themed with CSS variables
- Icon system integration with Mercedes-Benz approved iconography
- Responsive design patterns for tablet use in workshop environments

## Unresolved Items
All NEEDS CLARIFICATION items from the specification have been resolved through research.

## Next Phase Requirements
